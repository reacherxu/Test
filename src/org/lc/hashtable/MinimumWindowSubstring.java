 * Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S

For example,
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"
Minimum window is "BANC".

Note:
If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the emtpy string "".

If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that
 there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
